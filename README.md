# FarmerSuicideRate
This GitHub project aims to analyze the alarming issue of farmer suicides in India, exploring its correlation with various agrarian factors. 
# Description
Agriculture is said to be the backbone of our Nation. But still, the suicide rate of
individuals involved in the Agrarian sector is found to be above that of the other general
population of the nation. Many social, economic, and political factors have been identified by
the previous literature, which leads to the high number of farmers, 39 suicides in India. The
oscillating nature of the Indian Monsoon has also been told as a major factor in the farmers’
suicides. Being a very debatable topic, several organisations have made various claims about
the reasons behind this crisis. This study takes into consideration the claims made by a report
published in State of India’s Environment 2021 and analysed them using openly available
datasets of Rainfall deviation, Cost of Production, Economic support to the farmers, and
National and state-level agricultural indicators of the four major farmer suicide states:
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana for the year 2014-2021. It is found
that the suicide rate of farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana is decreasing over the years
and are found to have a great correlation with rainfall, labour wages, India crop production
index, and Economic Support. The Agricultural Labour wage has a great impact on the
suicide rate. With the increase in wage, the suicide rate was found to decrease. The study also
states the difficulties in finding the reason behind farmer suicides using public data.
